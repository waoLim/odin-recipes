# odin-recipes
Author: waoLim

In this project, I completed the first assignment in The Odin Project course. The website I created consists of a main index page with links to several recipes. While the recipe content is sourced from other sites, I developed the structure and layout independently. This project demonstrates my understanding of HTML elements including links, images, paths, lists, and paragraphs. Additionally, it served as an opportunity to enhance my Git and GitHub skills.

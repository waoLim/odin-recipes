    <h2>Golden Garlic Rice Symphony</h2>
    <p>This iconic Filipino breakfast staple transforms humble leftover rice into a fragrant, garlicky masterpiece that elevates any morning meal.</p>
    <p>The magic of sinangag lies in two key elements: day-old rice and perfectly toasted garlic. Using chilled, leftover rice ensures firm, separate grains that wonâ€™t clump together when fried. The garlic is slowly toasted until golden brown, creating both crispy bits for garnish and a flavorful oil that infuses the entire dish.</p>

    <h3>What you'll need</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups cooked rice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil, for frying</li>
        <li>12 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2-3 tsp liquid seasoning, to taste (can be substituted with soy sauce)</li>
        <li>Green onions, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Fry the minced garlic over medium heat for about 7-10 minutes in an oiled wok or pan until the garlic is crisp and golden (be careful not to burn them to avoid bitterness). Set aside the toasted garlic bits and reserve the remaining garlic-infused oil.</p></li>
        <li><p>In the same pan, add in the rice. Stir fry for about 2-3 minutes to allow all the rice grains to be coated in the garlic oil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Season the rice with liquid seasoning. Throw in about 2/3 of the reserved toasted garlic bits into the rice (reserving the rest for garnish). Continue to toss and stir fry over medium heat for an additional 1-2 minutes until the rice is heated through and all the ingredients are well combined.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve warm. Top with green onions and the reserved toasted garlic bits. Enjoy!</p></li>
